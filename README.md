Universal FSA
=============

A universal finite state automaton is a string-consuming mechanism that allows
for easy finite state automata (fsa) design and modification. It is a general
program that can consume multiple fsa designs and test strings for each fsa
machine. <br>

I have only tested this program using deterministic fsa machines. I included my
test cases along with descriptions of what each fsa machine should accept/
reject. You can try it out for yourself, I had fun writing this program and it's
more fun to run and see the results :)
